## About Lynx

Lynx is a _family_ of open-source technologies empowering developers to use their existing web skills to create truly native UIs for both mobile and web from a single codebase, focusing on performance at scale and development velocity.
- **üí´ Write Once, Render Anywhere:** Enjoy native rendering on Android, iOS, and Web, or pixel-perfect consistency across platforms via our custom renderer.
- **üåê Web-Inspired Design:** Leverage your existing knowledge of CSS and React. We designed Lynx with web standards and libraries in mind.
- **‚ö° Performance at Scale:** Achieve instant launch times and smooth UI responsiveness through our multithreaded engine, whether standalone or embedded.

This repository contains the **core engine** of Lynx. For other repositories in the Lynx family, visit our [org homepage](https://github.com/lynx-family).


## Documentation
You shall find documentation for Lynx on [lynxjs.org](http://lynxjs.org).

## How to Use Lynx
### Requirements
Lynx apps support iOS 10 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer.

We recommend using macOS for development. Windows and Linux support is not yet verified or guaranteed, so you may encounter issues. If you need assistance, please file an issue, and we'll be happy to help.

### Getting Started Guide
- Get started with [Hello World](https://lynxjs.org/guide/start/quick-start.html)
- Learn about [Integrating Lynx with Existing Applications](https://lynxjs.org/guide/start/integrate-with-existing-apps.html)

## How to Contribute
### Get the Code
Before cloning the repository, please take an additional step.

To effectively manage dependencies using our custom tool, [Habitat](https://github.com/lynx-family/habitat), we recommend creating a dedicated directory.
For example, create a directory named `src`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx.git src/lynx
```

Initially, `src` will contain only `lynx`. As you build Lynx, additional dependencies will be installed there.
This structure helps keep your workspace organized.

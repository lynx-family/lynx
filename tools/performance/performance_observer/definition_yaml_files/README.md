# PerformanceEntry Definitions

## Description
The YAML files in this directory are used to describe PerformanceEntries for the PerformanceObserver functionality. The `generate_performance_entry.py` script will generate corresponding JAVA/OC/TS definition files based on all the YAML files in this directory.

Location of TS output: `lynx/js_libraries/types/types/background-thread/lynx-performance-entry.d.ts`

## Usage
If you are modifying an existing PerformanceEntry, simply modify the desired yml file. ðŸ˜Š

If you are adding a new PerformanceEntry, create it and then add it to `tools/performance/performance_observer/performance_entry_definition_files`. ðŸ‘·

### File Syntax
Your PerformanceEntry file should consist of a new filename, inheritance, and variable definitions. Its basic structure should resemble the code below:

```yaml
# NewEntry.yml
NewEntry:
  allOf:
    - $ref: 'PerformanceEntry.yml#/PerformanceEntry'
    - type: object
      properties:
        propName:
            type: string
```

First, `allOf` indicates that your definition inherits from PerformanceEntry. You must ensure that the NewEntry you define has an inheritance relationship with PerformanceEntry.

Next, you can define your basic data types as follows:

```yaml
name:
    type: number/string/string/map
```

Or, define more complex object types as follows:

```yaml
name:
    $ref: 'ReferenceObject.yml#/ReferenceObject'
```

### Extension Syntax
To facilitate organizing multi-terminal outputs, we added three descriptors `x-ignore-java`, `x-ignore-oc`, and `x-ignore-ts` to control whether to generate code for specific languages. You can use these extension tags as shown in the code below:

```yaml
// NewEntry.yml
NewEntry:
  x-ignore-java: False
  x-ignore-oc: True
  x-ignore-ts: False
  allOf:
    - $ref: 'PerformanceEntry.yml#/PerformanceEntry'
    - type: object
      properties:
        propName:
            type: string
```
